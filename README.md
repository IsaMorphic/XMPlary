# XMPlary
An exchange format exporter for the obscure Xbox XM model files

Use on command line like so: `xmplary <input-xm-path> <output-obj-path>`
Not all files work

TODO:
* Add support for normals (do files with these exist?)
* Add support for different primitive types (only triangle lists are supported right now)
* Figure out why texture coordinate exporting might be fricked in some files where they exist

Pull requests welcome.
